# My-Portfolio
My Portfolio page

This is my portfolio web page. It contains my current line of work, my studies; Thinkful Coding Cootcamp.
There is a list of languages I have learned and what I like to do in my down time.
There is a sample project section, I do not have any projects to load, I have only been coding three weeks.
At the bottom is my contact info along with a map of Chicago, where I live.

## Special Thanks
Thank you to Thinkful for pushing me everyday with new curriculum.
